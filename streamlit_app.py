                    **Strengths:** Shorter and more naturally phrased prompts, complex intent, cause and effect.

                    Curie-instruct is very capable but faster and lower cost than davinci-instruct. Part of the Instruct series is better at following instructions than the Base series. 

                    **Strengths:** Shorter and more naturally phrased prompts, language translation, complex classification, sentiment.
